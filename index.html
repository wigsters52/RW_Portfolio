        Hello, my name is Ryan. I am a full stack web developer living in
        Cleveland, OH. My main talents(still young but growing) are javascript,
        both front and backend and MYSQL. While I am trying to master thoughs I
        am constantly learning. Taking on frameworks is my next progression and
        am diving deep into VueJs. When not learning or working on a project, I
        get to hang out with my wife and dog, Sam and Ted. I love to golf(not
        well), ride my bicycle, drink coffee and eat tacos. Living near or in
        Cleveland most of my life I grew up loving the Browns, Indians and
        Cavs(we miss you Lebron)
